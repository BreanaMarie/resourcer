# Refer Me

Refer Me is a network that connects folks looking to be referred into a company with those open to referring them.

Technologies:
	- Ruby on Rails 
	- Postgres


Assumptions:

- Candidates want an easier way to find referrals if they do not currently know someone at a specific company 

- Employees would be open to talking to folks interested in being referred into their company, especially if their company provides a referral bonus 



The MVP for Resourcer allows for both the referral source (Sourcer) and the person looking to be referred (Candidate) to create a profile and search for one another. Companies often pay hefty referral bonuses on hires sourced by their employees, so employees can sign up with Resourcer and indicate that they are willing to speak to and potentially refer interested parties. On the candidate side, if they know of a company they are interested in/role they are looking at, but don’t know anyone within that company/industry, they can search and see how many potential sourcers are on the network and contact directly in order to open up a dialogue. This would allow for us to create opportunity on both the employer and potential employee side by facilitating “informational interviews” with the intent of a referral.
